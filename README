This package containe:

- the log files of JHU for the extraction of decay weights into WW
- the script used to submit the JHU jobs (runJHUDecay.sh)
- the program parse.py to parse those log files and create a pickle file with the information to be used for decay weights determination in BWReweightingEWKSinglet
- the program anaIntegral.py which extracts the global integrals of the samples reweightd with BWReweightingEWKSinglet and computes the global shift to be used to recover normalization
